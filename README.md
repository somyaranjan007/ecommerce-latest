We have an ecommerce project based on React, Node and MongoDB. We call it the sunlife-ecommerce project.

We have to enable websites to carry out payments in cryptocurrency, using Smart Contracts. This project incorporates the following technologies:

- Ethereum Smart Contracts
- Solidity
- OpenZeppelin
- Truffle
- Front End (HTML, CSS, BootStrap, Javascript, React JS)
- Back End (Node JS, KOA Framework, MongoDB)

We have used Reactjs to make the UI E-commerce website and we have to use DAI cryptocurrency for the payments. For designing and coding the smart contracts in our application we have to use Solidity, OpenZeppelin and Truffle. We have to use the DAI stable coin for carrying out transactions which is one of the most popular stable coins and most decentralized. One DAI is always equal to one dollar. Firstly we have to build the front end where the user will be able to access the application with a web browser. We have to build a backend which ties and connects our smart contracts and the working of the crypto network with the user interface. We have to use the MongoDB database where all the payments are stored and tracked. And finally we have to use the Etherum blockchain which consists of the PaymentProcessor smart contract and the ERC20 token contract where the actual payments are done and validated.
